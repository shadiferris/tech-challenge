# Tech-Challenge

## Requirement

```Using either AWS or GCP, create a website that displays some static text (you will not be judged on your HTML skills, and feel free to stick within the free/trial tiers for the resources you create). The text should include your name, for example, “This is Mary Smith’s website”```

## Solution

[Shadi Ferris Website](http://shadi-ferris-technical-challenge.s3-website-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/)

## Summary

○   What else you would do with your website, and how you would go about doing it if you had more time?

○   Alternative solutions that you could have taken but didn’t and explain why?

○   What would be required to make this a production grade website that would be developed by various development teams. The more detail, the better?
